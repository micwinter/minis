# minis
Small projects for various purposes.

1. Connect Four

    Play connect four using the `connect_four.py` script. To play, run `python connect_four.py` in your terminal. You can either play against another human (player 2) or play against a rather naive but annoying computer.

2. Crackle pop

    Crackle pop is a program that prints out the numbers 1 to 100 and will output some text depending on whether the number is divisible by specific numbers. To run: `python cracklepop.py`.

3. Water boiler

    Written during Creative Coding at Recurse Center. Based on the prompt "Write something boring", it is a script that generates numbers (while water is boiling) and if those numbers add up to a threshold, water will boil and an ASCII image of water boiling will appear in terminal. To run: `python water_boiler.py`.
